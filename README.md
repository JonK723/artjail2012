## Art Jail 2012

A conversion of the Art Jail website from Flash to HTML 5.
The original Flash based Art Jail website was developed in Flash but due to iOS not supporting Flash the site needed to be converted to HTML. JQuery was the primary tool to facilitate managing the navigation while SVG was used for the interface elements of the video player buttons as well as a the map for the contact 'page'. To create the animated background the image sequence was mapped to the horizontal position of the mouse cursor and the appropriate image is loaded as the background image.
